Generally, there are 4 stage for this case study, which is P(Plan), A (Analyze), C (Construct), E (Execution). The project is also covered the application of machine learning models which includes logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBoost classifier algorithmn to construct the best models for better prediction of the customer satisfactions based on the features (service ratings) provided by the company. The dataset publicly available through online.

The project has provided dataset and also the python script. Within the jupyter notebook, I have provided the steps and explanation for my analysis, together with the machine learning models that would be used.
